**Shelving** is a toolkit for using data in JavaScript and TypeScript, including:

- Schemas (validation)
- Databases (via providers including in-memory, Firestore, IndexedDB)
- Querying (sorting, filtering, slicing)
- State (events and state)
- React (hooks and state)
- Helpers (errors, arrays, objects, strings, dates, equality, merging, diffing, cloning, debug)

## Installation

```sh
npm install shelving
```

## Usage

Shelving is an [ES module](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html) using `import { etc } from "shelving";` syntax. It does not generate code for CommonJS `require()` style imports, so requires a system that supports that like Dino or Node 12 or higher.
